    - **Correlation Coefficient** between NVIDIA and Bitcoin prices shows the **strength of linear relationship**.
    - **Regression analysis** suggests that fluctuations in NVIDIA's stock price may **partially explain movements in Bitcoin**.
    - **R-squared** value quantifies how much variance in Bitcoin prices is explained by NVIDIA â€” not causation, but indication.
    - **Residual patterns** help assess model fit; ideally, they should be randomly scattered for a valid regression.
    - **Volatility analysis** (from Page 1) reveals **Bitcoin tends to be more volatile** than NVIDIA.

    Based on our analysis:
    
    - There is **some degree of synchronization** between tech market dynamics (e.g., NVIDIA's performance) and the crypto market.
    - This might be attributed to shared investor sentiment, speculative trends, or macroeconomic factors.
    - While correlation and regression exist, **NVIDIA is not a strong predictor** of Bitcoin price by itself.
    - Investors should treat such relationships as **insights**, not predictions.
